X Basic Graphs is a prototype module release for adding JPGraph functionality 
to your XOOPS site so you can easily generate graphs and statistical charts. 
Please note that this module is built with JPGraph Library 2.3.4 which 
requires PHP5. The module contains the JPGraph Library and examples of how to 
create your own graphs. If you come up with graph creations you would like to 
share with others we will be happy to add these to the graphs subdirectory. 
We will be adding subdirectories to the graphs subdirectory labeled after 
the module they are associated with.
